# libharu-sys

Unsafe [libharu](http://libharu.org/) bindings for Rust.

## Dependencies

libharu optionally depends on zlib and libpng via compilation options. For now, both of these options are disabled, so utilizing any zlib or libpng functions will result in errors. Support will be added later, once the linking is figured out.
